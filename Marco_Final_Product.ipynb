    "\n",
    "**Real-Time Visual Understanding**\n",
    "- On-device scene comprehension: identify objects, read signage, translate text, and summarize whiteboards in one glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auditory + Visual Controls**\n",
    "- Whisper-quiet bone-conduction audio, discrete wake-word, glance-to-select UI, and two-finger frame gestures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foresight Cards**\n",
    "- Time- and location-aware cards (ETA, next meeting, files, reminders) appear contextually in the periphery—never intrusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private-by-Design**\n",
    "- Hardware kill-switch for cameras/mics, on-device redaction, and explicit sharing prompts. You decide what leaves the frame.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q: How does Visionary One anticipate actions?**  \n",
    "A: On-device models learn lightweight patterns from your context (time, location, recent activity) and surface suggestions. Nothing is shared without your consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I disable the camera/microphone?**  \n",
    "A: Yes — hardware switches cut power to sensors. A physical shutter covers the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Battery life?**  \n",
    "A: Typical all-day use with proactive features enabled; the Pro bridge adds rapid top-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Will it work with my apps?**  \n",
    "A: Yes — standard integrations (Calendar, Mail, Maps, Notes, Tasks, Slack, Spotify) plus a developer SDK.\n",
